# Welcome to Embark

## What is Embark?

Embark is an implementation of [backstage](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage). As they put it:

> Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. Powered by a centralized software catalog, Backstage restores order to your microservices and infrastructure and enables your product teams to ship high-quality code quickly â€” without compromising autonomy.

Any questions that aren't covered here should either be asked in the [lighthouse-bandicoot slack channel](https://lighthouseva.slack.com/archives/C020ZR4UL8H) or looked up within the [Backstage Documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage).
