## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities should be automatically detected prior to committing code by [Talisman](https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman) via pre-commit and after pushing to Github by [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot).

If a vulnerability that has not been covered by an automated mechanism is suspected, please send a message in the [Team Bandicoot Slack channel](https://lighthouseva.slack.com/archives/C020ZR4UL8H) or open an issue in this repository.
